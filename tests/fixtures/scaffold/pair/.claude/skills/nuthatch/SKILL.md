# Querying the nuthatch nest

Contracts indexed on mainnet:
- `uniswap_v2pair` = 0x9d593420cc4936b8a8435cdfa0d6bbde9bdff9a4

Data is local - never call an external API for it.

## Preferred: MCP
If a `nuthatch` MCP server is configured, use its tools. Call `schema` first to learn the
data model, then `sql` / `entity` / `balance` / `top_balances`.

## Fallback: HTTP (a `nuthatch dev` must be running)
- Recent rows:  `curl localhost:8288/entities?limit=20`
- Read-only SQL: `curl -G localhost:8288/sql --data-urlencode 'q=SELECT count(*) FROM uniswap_v2pair__approval'`

`sql` reads hot and sealed rows together, so it covers the live tip. Each answer's
`provenance.sealed_through` is where finalized data ends.
